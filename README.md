# Digit Recognization:
                    The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.
                   
##Classification of MNIST Handwritten Digits Database using Deep Learning

This repository contains code meant to classifiy MNIST Handwritten Digits usind Neural Networks.
I have used the data from the keras modules . The keras module is content many datasets such as MNIST digits classification dataset,
CIFAR10 small images classification dataset, CIFAR100 small images classification dataset, IMDB movie review sentiment, Fashion mnist datasets.
I am used the MNIST digits datasets and create a moduel whihc is predict the digit from 1 to 9 handwritten digit.

CNN is a mathematical construct that is typically composed of three types of layers (or building blocks): convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. The first two, convolution and pooling layers, perform feature extraction, whereas the third, a fully connected layer, maps the extracted features into final output, such as classification. A convolution layer plays a key role in CNN, which is composed of a stack of mathematical operations, such as convolution, a specialized type of linear operation. In digital images, pixel values are stored in a two-dimensional (2D) grid.

The best efficiency I obtained was 98.87% accuracy with a couple of convolutional layers, a fully connected layer of 28 neurons and an output softmax layer of 10 neuron. The network trained over 10 epochs, and it is work 100% currectly
